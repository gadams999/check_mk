nest
======
These are a series of check_mk checks for the Nest Thermostat. Checks are focused on those
measurements useful to check_mk / Nagios such and temperature, device status, etc.

The *Makefile* is used to develop and push changes to an OMD-specific installation.

The *mkp*, [nest.mkp][nest.mkp] file is a complete package that can be imported into a check_mk / OMD installation.

All files are under the share/check_mk directory structure and follow the same structure as those
under OMD (e.g., local/share/...)


## Overview of Use
Coming soon, a link to my blog on design and use. I may copy/pasta some of that over here, or just
leave the github content brief.
